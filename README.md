# Simple Expense Tracker ðŸ’¸

A basic GUI-based expense tracker designed with a focus on UI/UX rather than functionality. This is my first attempt at UI/UX design, and the main objective is to create an intuitive, easy-to-use interface for tracking expenses and remaining balance. The code serves as a foundation to demonstrate the UI, while the primary emphasis is on the user experience.

## How It Works
1. **Enter Starting Amount**: 
   - Input the total amount of money you currently have and click the **Enter** button.
   - The starting balance will be updated in the display.

2. **Track Expenses**:
   - To log an expense, enter the amount you spent in the **Expense** field and click the **Expense** button.
   - Your current balance will update automatically, subtracting the entered expense amount from your total balance.

This simple workflow allows for quick tracking of available funds and basic expense logging.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Emphasis on an intuitive, clean design to simplify expense tracking.
- **Basic Functionality**: Keeps track of the starting balance and updates the remaining balance as expenses are logged.

## Notes
Since this is my first foray into UI/UX design, the functionality of the application is intentionally kept simple. The focus is on building an effective, easy-to-understand interface rather than creating complex tracking features.
